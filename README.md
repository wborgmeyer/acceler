### Introduction

This is the programming assignment for Week 4 of "Getting and Cleaning Data"

### How to run

There is a single script titled run_analysis.R that will process the data.
It is assumed that the script will run from the working directory of the data extraction
(i.e "UCI HAR Dataset").  The R script will then process the data from features.txt,
features_info.txt, activity_labels.txt, and the data files in test and train.

The data summary data (averages) and written to the file averages.csv which is to be 
submitted as part of the assignment.
